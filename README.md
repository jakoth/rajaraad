# Rajaraad
Ancient Traditional Rajasthani 2 player game where the simple goal is to kill the opponents pieces.

## How To Play

1) Each player will start out with 16 pieces.
2) Click on the piece to show valud moves/jumps. If there are no valid moves, select another piece.
3) If there are multiple jumps possible, and the player has jumped once, it is compulsory to jump all of the remaining jumps.
4) You cannot jump over your own piece.
5) Jump over an opponent's piece to eliminate the piece from the game.
6) If one player eliminates all the pieces of the other player, they win.
7) In the situation of a player not having a valud move, but having a piece, the game will result in a draw. 
8) If no piece is eliminated in 25 moves (25 moves by white and 25 moves by black) the game will result in a draw.
9) If 3 moves are repeated, the game results in a draw.
10) Have Fun!
